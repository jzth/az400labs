pipeline integration bug:

https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/11876

Update on above issue, after downgraded to Jenkins version 2.164.3 and TFS plugin 5.142.0 , 
i was able to build my pipeline successfully. Even though it is a bug in Jenkins, 
later point of time it will come as an issue. 
So this issue needs to be fixed.Please let me know if any updates.

how to overcome
1. go to http://localhost:8080/configureSecurity/
2. change *Access Control* to  Logged-in users can do anything 
3. disable CSRF protection 

Run the pipeline again
